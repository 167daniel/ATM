"""
This module manages the in-memory storage of account objects for the Mini ATM system.

Responsibilities:
- Maintain a dictionary mapping account numbers to Account instances.
- Provide functions to retrieve, create, and in further versions delete accounts.
- Initialize example accounts for testing purposes.
- Raise appropriate exceptions if accounts are not found or duplicates are created.

Note:
- Data is stored only in-memory and will be lost if the server restarts.
- Account creation and deletion are currently out of scope and mainly included for testing and future extension.

# In-memory dictionary holding all accounts
# Keys are account numbers (strings) which uniquely identify each account.

# Important: The dictionary keys MUST match the 'account_number' attribute of the corresponding Account object for
# consistency and correctness.
